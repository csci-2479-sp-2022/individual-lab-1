	<p>
		I am originally from Columbus Ohio. I was born here and hope to stay here. <br><br>
		My major at Cstate is the associates of applied sciences of web development, I am on what is hopefully my second to last semester
		and only have the capstone and a gen ed left to take in order to graduate<br><br>
		After i graduate school i hope to find a career that pays well enough to sustain a family. <br><br>
		I enjoy doing a lot of things, but my biggest hobbie is playing and learning about boardgames. A few of my favorites are: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Mage Knight</li>
			<li>Tortuga</li>
			<li>War of the Ring</li>
			<li>Blood Rage</li>
			<li>Escape the dark castle</li>
			<li>scythe</li>
			<li>spirit island</li>
			<li>Gloomhaven</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
		And honestly I could name more. Along with boardgames I also really enjoy being outdoors. I love to camp, fish, and hunt
		as well as play most any sports. I played baseball for most of my childhood and now I play on an adult softball team. I was also
		on my highschools bowling team and very much love to bowl. <br>
		Another important aspect about myself that I dont know if I would consider a hobby is that I enjoy to study the bible, as well as 
		investigate and learn about other worldviews and why people believe them.
