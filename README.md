# individual-lab-1
This is where everyone will submit their work for Lab 1

## Lab One

### Context
This assignment is not related to your project, per se. However, I am using it to divide you up into your project teams so you can practice a typical SDLC workflow from a team perspective. To do this assignment, we will be using git as our source control and Github as our project management tool.

### The Teams
It is up to you to come up with legendary team names.

- Team One
  - Shahem Chatman Coates
  - James McCue
  - Joe Robbins
  - Carrie Kohner

- Team Two
  - Farhan Barre
  - Joseph Ambrozich
  - Tadios Desta
  - Harrison Xu

- Team Three
  - Mihaela Valac
  - Ben Wagner
  - Aiden Smith
  - Brian Emery

### Acceptance criteria
I have created three [milestones](https://github.com/csci-2479-sp-2022/individual-lab-1/milestones), one for each team. Each team needs to do the following:
1. Create an issue in your milestone to create an `index.html` file for your team directory
2. Create an issue in your milestone for each person on the team with the following requirements:
   - Create an html file with the name `firstname-lastname.html` under your team directory
   - This file should contain a brief bio about yourself. Feel free to include information similar to what was shared in the icebreaker, such as:
     - Where you are from originally
     - Your major/track at CSCC
     - What you hope to do after school
     - What you enjoy doing as a hobby or pastime
   - Create a link to this file on your team's `index.html` page
3. Each student needs to work at least one issue (someone will have to do the team index.html issue as well) and do the following:
   1. Create a feature branch for their work with the name format `feature/your-feature-name`, e.g. `feature/andrew-harris-bio-page`
   2. Once the work is finished, commit everything to your branch locally, and then push the branch to Github.
   3. Create a pull request (PR) and a sign a teammate as a reviewer
      - Also make sure to [link the PR to your issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue); I tend to use the keywords in the PR description like "resolves #11"
   4. Review another teammate's pull request
      - In this case, we're mostly writing content, not code, but we can still look for properly formatted HTML documents, etc.
      - See [this blog](https://www.ombulabs.com/blog/best-practices/pull-requests/our-code-review-etiquette.html) for help understanding what is good code review etiquette.
      - I expect to see at least one comment per PR; if nothing else, a simple "Everything looks great, approving!" will suffice.
   5. The student who created the PR should merge the PR once it is approved, and they should also verify that the issue is closed.
